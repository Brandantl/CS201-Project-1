C++

Sample input: no greather than +/-2^64-1. (32)

Known Issues and limitations:
There is probably other ways to break it by dumping a large amount of text into it or something, symbols, etc. 

Algorithm:
Prompt user for input
Check if input is the right type or not, if not, prompt the user to enter a correct INT64
Check if the input > 0, if not prompt the user to reenter a valid INT64.
Modulus the decimal number by 2 then add it to binary (a stringstream). (side note: negitive ints were converted to positive ints) 
Then shift decimal over 1 and loop until decimal is >= 1
Then print the output as a string because stoi and atoi were causing headakes.
